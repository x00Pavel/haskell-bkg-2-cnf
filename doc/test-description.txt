Directory extra/ contains extra tests I made for this project. Tests are written
using Python library for test - PyTest. Main design of the test is following:
- Before each test run, source code is recompiled
- Tests are separated to the files based on the aspect each test is checking
  (e.g test_args.py contains tests for testing correct processing of input
  arguments, test_cnf.py contains tests for checking that program converts input
  grammar to CNF with specified rules)
- Most of the tests contains also input file with input grammar. But not each
  test contains output file to compare with, because for example for testing
  of specific rule or non-terminal is present in the output, simple loop
  with checking substring in the output is used. This approach is more robust
  to reordering of the rules or non-terminals
- Input files are also separated to the directories based on the target test.
  Some input files are duplicated because with same input file, testing target
  is different (e.g for same grammar there is separate test for removing simple
  rules and separate test for CNF)
- Even when some test files visually contains only one test, these test is
  executed several times with different test arguments (input file and output
  file) using parametrisation.
